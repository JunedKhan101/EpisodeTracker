<h1 style="text-align: center;">Episode Tracker</h1>
<div style="font-size: 20px; width: 50%; position: absolute; left: 28%;">
<p>This website allows you track how many episodes you've watched in a series.</p>
<p>
Your streaming site may already have this feature but it's not that reliable because they are stored in browsers (session/cookies, browser cache, browser's local Storage/session Storage). All of which can get easily deleted if your browser gets updated, reinstalled or if you're watching on a different browser or on a different machine.
</p>
<p>
	There are some TV series that are notoriously long. It's easy to get lost and forget where were you, this is where our website comes in rescue.
</p>
<p>
	You can create/add series <a style="color: blue;" href="/series">here</a>, each series can have multiple seasons if you want to track series with multiple seasons just check "My series contain multiple seasons" when you add a series doing so would allow you to track multiple seasons separately, unchecking this option would allow you to track episodes within series directly.
